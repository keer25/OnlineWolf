rails-api requires ruby 1.9.3 or higher

Any of these middlewares can be added via:

config.middleware.use Rack::MethodOverride

config.middleware.delete ::Rack::Sendfile

Removed Rack::Lock middleware due to websocket-rails

STARTED USING HEROKU BECAUSE OF NOT BEING ABLE TO ACHEIVE PORT FORWARDING

websocket-rails is more appropriate for non API and using it with a javascript client rather than a native Android client

Switched to em-ruby

em-websocket
May have to switch to a different server
Using ws://
Temperory testign with js client
Removed Rack::Lock middleware
